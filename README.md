# Machine Learning â€“ 2020.2

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of exercises and projects developed during the **Machine Learning course** I completed in the second semester of 2020. Throughout the course, I built a strong theoretical foundation and gained extensive hands-on experience with the most important techniques in the field.

## Course Overview

The curriculum covered the essential principles of supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and practical implementation using real-world datasets. By the end of the course, I had acquired the knowledge and skills to confidently apply machine learning to a wide range of problems.

## What I Learned:
- Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, k-NN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation and performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Bias-variance tradeoff and overfitting prevention
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Takeaway

This course marked a turning point in my journey as a data scientist, allowing me to **master the core techniques of Machine Learning** and apply them with confidence and precision. The knowledge gained laid a solid foundation for more advanced topics such as Deep Learning and real-world AI applications.
